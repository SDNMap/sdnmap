# SDNMap #

Please make sure that you have Python, Scapy 2.2, installed on your Linux system since these are required to run SDNMap.

### Using SDNMap

SDNMap is a scanning tool to reconstruct the composition of OpenFlow rules in SDN networks from a source host to any destination host in a network.
No prior knowledge of the SDN controller or network is required. 

SDNMap is an open-source software and can be used under the terms of the Creative Commons (CC0) license.
For details about the functionality of SDNMap we refer to the research paper "Adversarial Network Forensics in Software Defined Networking" (currently under review).

Please keep in mind that SDNMap is a research protoype. We appreciate all suggestions to improve it.
Contact us with any questions, bugs, etc. at: sdnmap@gmail.com

We made two videos to demonstrate SDNMap:
- Reconstruct Floodlight's Access Control List with SDNMap: https://youtu.be/rTMYvoRFc0U
- Reconstruct Floodlight's Load Balancing as a Service application with SDNMap: https://youtu.be/9v7mjMrkxHk


----------------------------------------
### Scanning hosts with SDNMap

To perform a flow rules reconstruction scan, the user has to provide the following input arguments to SDNMap:

- IP address prefix to scan (e.g. 10.0.0.0/24 for a range of hosts or 10.0.0.2/32 for a single host)
- The selected scanning protocol (ICMP or TCP)
- The network interface of the host (e.g. eth0)
- A list of ports in [] separated by a comma (',') that should be scanned for TCP and UDP, e.g. [80,443], or an empty list [] if exact port numbers should not be scanned

SDNMap has to be executed with root privileges. An example for starting SDNMap to scan the network 10.0.0.0/24 with TCP and evaluate ports 80 and 443 looks like the following:

*sudo python main.py 10.0.0.0/24 TCP eth0 [80,443]*

After the completion of a scan, SDNMap will print a list of reconstructed flow rules.

In the following we show example outputs of two scans performed by SDNMap:

--- Determine if ingress port is enforced ---
Selecting two hosts to use for probing...
Sending Ping request from 10.0.0.3 / 00:00:00:00:00:03 to 10.0.0.2 / 00:00:00:00:00:02
Received ARP request for 10.0.0.3 --> ingress port is not checked

 ------- Reconstructed rules ---------
match=type:arp,arp_op=1 actions=FLOOD
match=type:ip,nw_dst:10.0.0.3 actions=output:#OUT_PORT
match=type:ip,nw_dst:10.0.0.1 actions=output:#OUT_PORT
match=type:ip,nw_dst:10.0.0.2 actions=output:#OUT_PORT
match=type:ip,nw_dst:10.0.0.1 actions=output:#OUT_PORT
 -------------------------------------
```
-------------------------------------------------------------

In the shown example above, the rule "match=type:ip,nw_dst:10.0.0.1 actions=output:#OUT_PORT" is shown twice since they are the return rules from 10.0.0.2 and from 10.0.0.3
